I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department](https://mae.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University, working with [Professor Luc Deike](https://ldeike.princeton.edu).

My thesis focuses on the dynamics of ocean surface waves in the context of air-sea interaction. In general, my research interests include fluid dynamics, waves, turbulence, ocean physics, climate modeling, and computational methods. Here is my [CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/CV-Wu-2022.pdf).

I am original from Huzhou, China, and I speak Mandarin. In my free time, I enjoy playing volleyball, making food, taking photos, and mostly recently learning about music theory.
